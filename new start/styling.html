        <p>The famous quote "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds" is attributed to J. Robert Oppenheimer, an American
        physicist and one of the key figures in the development of the atomic bomb. He reportedly said this quote after
        witnessing the first successful test of a nuclear bomb, the Trinity test, on July 16, 1945, as part of the Manhattan
        Project during World War II. The quote is a reference to a line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
